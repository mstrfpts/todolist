This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Details of the App:
1. The App has a message on the landing page stating there are no task and requesting you to add tasks.
2. There is an arrow below the message which can be used to add tasks.
3. On clicking the Add tasks button, you would see a modal to add your task details and images if needed.
4. The modal has a validation over the details added.
5. The tasks added are persisted in local storage and can survive a refresh.
6. Upon adding a task, you will be show the tasks on the main page.
7. The tasks have due date information and the color of the task box indicates the status.

Tech details:
1. The app has been completed using React Template(npm create-react-app)
2. It uses React functional components and Hooks.
3. The styling has been squeezed into a single file, which would be split accross files further down.
4. The site may not be very responsive again something, I would take on later.

Conclusion: My approach to creating an app like this start with basic design of the flow and data structures to hold the data. This planning involves a deep look at the data needed to avoid a rework after getting half way. I then try and implement the design and solve possible bugs along the way. I usually work on the funcitonality to get to a point where I feel content before moving into styling.etc. 
Finally, this is yet to be completed!
